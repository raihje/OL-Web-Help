Character Helper and Searchable Banes/Boons with responsive design using bootstrap.
This is a new project I'm working on to have a fast and responsive character builder
that works on anything with a browser.
Aside from Bootstrap I'll be using a combination of AJAX and PHP.
In the future I may use a database (or Firebase) for pulling data.

A sister project of this will be to parse YAML into JSON to be sent to a server using Firebases SDK.
If that project is successful, the results will be used to keep this helper up to date with the core open legend rules.
