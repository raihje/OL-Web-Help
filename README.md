# OL-Web-Help
Character Helper and Searchable Banes/Boons with responsive design using bootstrap.

## Design Goal
I hope to have something similar to what grimoire was for DND 5E. An easily searchable/sortable list
of applicable effects, alongside a character builder that displays banes available to a character as they're
being built.

## Tools being used.
Aside from Bootstrap I'll be using a combination of AJAX and PHP.
In the future I may use a database (or Firebase) for pulling data.

## Firebase
A sister project of this will be to parse YAML into JSON to be sent to a server using Firebases SDK.
If that project is successful, the results will be used to keep this helper up to date with the core open legend rules.
